# Educational Initiatives - Coding Challenge Submission


---
## üìÇ Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders, one for each exercise:

-   **/Exercise1_DesignPatterns**: A Maven project containing six runnable examples, each demonstrating a fundamental software design pattern with a real-world use case.
-   **/Exercise2_ClassroomManager**: A complete, terminal-based Maven application for managing virtual classrooms, students, and assignments.

---
## üöÄ How to Set Up and Run

Both projects are standard Maven projects and are best run using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

### Exercise 1: Design Patterns Demo

1.  Open your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ).
2.  Go to **File -> Open...** and select the **`Exercise1_DesignPatterns`** folder from this repository.
3.  The IDE will automatically recognize it as a Maven project and set it up.
4.  To run any of the six pattern examples, navigate to its demo file (e.g., `src/main/java/com/designpatterns/creational/factory/FactoryDemo.java`), right-click on the file, and select **Run**.

### Exercise 2: Virtual Classroom Manager

1.  Open your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ).
2.  Go to **File -> Open...** and select the **`Exercise2_ClassroomManager/VirtualClassroomManager`** folder.
3.  The IDE will set up the Maven project.
4.  Navigate to the main application file: `src/main/java/com/edtech/classroom/main/Main.java`.
5.  Right-click on the `Main.java` file and select **Run 'Main.main()'**.
6.  The interactive terminal application will start in your IDE's run console, ready to accept commands.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Commands for Exercise 2 (Virtual Classroom Manager)

The application accepts the following commands. Arguments that contain spaces (like assignment details) are fully supported.

| Command                                             | Description                                        |
| :-------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| `add_classroom <ClassName>`                         | Creates a new virtual classroom.                   |
| `add_student <StudentID> <ClassName>`               | Enrolls a student in a specific classroom.         |
| `schedule_assignment <ClassName> <Details>`         | Schedules a new assignment for a class.            |
| `submit_assignment <StudentID> <ClassName> <Details>` | Marks an assignment as submitted by a student.     |
| `list_classrooms`                                   | Lists the names of all created classrooms.         |
| `list_students <ClassName>`                         | Lists all students enrolled in a specific class.   |
| `list_assignments <ClassName>`                      | Lists all assignments scheduled for a specific class. |
| `assignment_status <ClassName> <Details>`           | Shows which students have submitted an assignment. |
| `remove_classroom <ClassName>`                      | Deletes a classroom.                               |
| `exit`                                              | Shuts down the application.                        |

## üí° Key Design Decisions & Features

### Exercise 1: Design Patterns Implemented

-   **Behavioural Patterns**
    -   **COMMAND:** Encapsulates a request as an object. Demonstrated with a **Restaurant Ordering System**.
    -   **STRATEGY:** Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable. Demonstrated with an **Image Compression Tool**.
-   **Creational Patterns**
    -   **FACTORY:** Creates objects without exposing creation logic. Demonstrated with a **Document Converter**.
    -   **SINGLETON:** Ensures a class has only one instance. Demonstrated with a **Game Settings Manager**.
-   **Structural Patterns**
    -   **FACADE:** Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. Demonstrated with a **Smart Home Control Panel**.
    -   **ADAPTER:** Makes incompatible interfaces work together. Demonstrated with a **Social Media Sharing Integration**.

### Exercise 2: Architecture and Principles

-   The application is built on the **Facade Pattern** (`VirtualClassroomManager`) to provide a simple and clean interface to the system, and the **Factory Pattern** (`EntityFactory`) to decouple object creation.
-   The code is structured to follow **SOLID principles**, particularly the Single Responsibility Principle and the Dependency Inversion Principle.
-   **Gold Standard** features like a decoupled logging mechanism, custom exception handling, and performance optimization (using `HashMap`) are included as per the requirements.
